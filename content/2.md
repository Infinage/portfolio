''An asymmetric, data-type-agnostic score for predictive relationships between two columns that ranges from 0 to 1."  
  
PPS works not just for numeric data, but also works for Categorical data. It's asymmetrical and what's cooler is the fact that it captures ALL kinds of relationships between the columns from linear to guassian.   
  
To those of you interested just in implementing PPS:  
1. Install with:   
pip install ppscore  
  
2. Calculating PPS for given DataFrame:   
import ppscore as pps  
pps.score(df, "feature_column", "target_column")  
  
3. Calculating PPS for whole DataFrame:  
pps.matrix(df)
