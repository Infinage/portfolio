Hello, Machine learning enthusiasts! I often wondered why a lot of people switch over to pytorch a while after they had dwelled into keras. The unanimous reply was that it's because of the flexibility and control that it offers to its users and its lack thereof in keras. Being someone who liked sticking to things, I sought out to explore keras in depth & conclude if that was indeed the case myself.   
  
Around the same time, I was also fortunate to be introduced to the book: "Hands on Machine Learning With Scikit Learn & TensorFlow, [Aurélien Géron](https://www.linkedin.com/in/ACoAABGmkl8BnNMBQdplk66mZC_I3W-CP7_ABWA)" by [Krish Naik](https://www.linkedin.com/in/ACoAABKjUsgBtR8BpVfIPwdOK9_ACjW2ffZObGY) through his amazing YouTube channel. And I found there, chapters that beautifully explain the brilliance of tf.keras, the flexibility and control that it offers to its users, contrary to what most beleive.   
  
I have documented my explorations as a guide for anyone who might be interested in exploring tf.keras. It is a work in progress & my ultimate aim when I'm done, is to be able to tell you guys: "This is all you will ever need to implement any research paper you may come across".  
  
Do give it a read and let me know your thoughts! Have an amazing day!
