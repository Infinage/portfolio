Hey Connections! I'm thrilled to share that I've secured the 158th rank (top 5%) out of 3k+ participants and managed to bag a silver in the "RIIID! Answer correctness predictions" Competition where we are to predict just as the title suggests, the probability of a student answering a question correctly. My solution was a combination of LGBMs and a FTRL model.   
  
This competition was challenging to me on a whole lot of ways. Two of the most challenging aspects were:   
  
1. The size of the dataset: 5GB of raw csv tabular Data. Threw plenty of OOM errors. Overcame this aspect by feature engineering piece by piece and training on a subset of data at a time.  
  
2. Kaggle time series API: This was probably the most challenging aspect for every participant of this competition. Threw plenty of submission scoring errors. The key was to create a lot of helper functions and a few edge cases the pipline might see during inference.   
  
I was also fortunate to be introduced to a lot of awesome frameworks such as Dask, DataTable, etc. Numba is another one of my recent fav. 50x speed up of python functions with a simple decorator anyone?  
  
I'm now officially a kaggle competitions expert and I look forward to doing plenty more competitions in the future!
