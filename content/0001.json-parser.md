# JSON Parser with C++

Whenever I searched for interesting projects, I'd often come across the same kinds: e-commerce sites, to-do lists, or employee management systems. While those have their merits, I found them a bit repetitive and not as fun. I wanted something deeper, something that really pushed my skills-challenging and equally rewarding. That's when I stumbled upon John Crickett's Coding Challenges. Neatly organized and structured, these projects range from simpler ones like Minesweeper to intricate challenges like building your own Docker. It's a great resource for anyone looking to level up their game by building real-world tools.

I decided to take on building a JSON Parser-reasoning that it wouldn't require much beyond the basic libraries that come with any programming language. To make it even more challenging, I chose C++ as the implementation language. It seemed simple at first, but it quickly became much more complex than I had anticipated.

Designing a tree-like data structure for the parser was a key part of the project. While I had an intuitive sense of this, it wasn't until I found a helpful Stack Overflow thread that I could properly visualize how everything fit together. I also leveraged inheritance to reference different types of JSON nodes.

Here are some cool things I picked up along the way:

1. Object Slicing: Casting from a base class to a derived class can cause data in the derived class to be 'sliced' off. Solution? Pass by reference or use pointers.
2. Rvalue References (&&): Similar to passing by reference but allows you to pass temporary objects directly.
3. Variants: Variants (std::variant) let you store one value from a set of predefined types-perfect for handling JSON values of different types.
4. Namespaces: As someone new to C++, discovering namespaces helped me neatly organize the code into logical blocks.
5. Smart Pointers: I initially used raw pointers but later switched to shared pointers to better manage memory and avoid manual cleanup.
6. GDB: I encountered a lot of segmentation faults along the way. GDB gave me an "interpreter-like" experience, letting me trace code flow line by line. It was super helpful for pinpointing where things went wrong, using commands like catch throw and backtrace to trace errors.

Itâ€™s a header-only library with examples for creating, validating, and manipulating JSON documents. I've also included a comprehensive set of tests (36 from json.org's JSON test suite and 318 extras from the nst/JSONTestSuite GitHub repository) for anyone who wants to experiment with the library.
