Hey folks, I'm thrilled to share that I'm now a certified TensorFlow Developer!

I would like to share a few tips and tricks that helped me with my exam.   
  
My Exam Strategy:  
  
1 Start with Baselines: Begin by creating baseline submissions for all questions. Don't worry about the score initially. The goal is to complete all questions with a baseline submission within an hour. This helps catch early mistakes and ensures error-free submissions.  
  
2 Fine-Tune: Your focus here is to get the best possible score. Don't rely solely on the scores from the exam submission. Instead, trust the train/val splits you've created. I found the exam submission results to be a bit unreliable. If your model performs well on your splits, you'll definitely score well on the exam submission as well.  
  
3 Model Documentation Matters: Use TensorBoard to save train/val loss scores along with the model for each question. This keeps you on the right track during the exam's rush.  
  
Remember, achieving a 5/5 on all questions is challenging but attainable. By following the advice shared above, you'll have more time to tune hyperparameters effectively. I scored a perfect 5/5 on all the questions, and you can too!   
  
Let's keep learning and striving for excellence, for as Aristotle said, 'We are what we repeatedly do. Excellence, then, is not an act, but a habit.'
