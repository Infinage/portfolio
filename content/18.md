I decided to build my first "Full-stack" C++ application - a URL Shortener inspired by [John Crickett](https://www.linkedin.com/in/ACoAAAAADOIB1jesEqZdnwQE5csLme2tAbpHuMg)'s coding challenges. It was a great opportunity to deepen my understanding of async programming while keeping external dependencies to a bare minimum.  
  
The backend was straightforward. I implemented a static counter that increments with each new URL. Using a stream cipher, I encoded this counter value and then converted it to Base62. To keep things lightweight (read: I was lazy), I opted for an in-memory backend. All network operations would happen via raw TCP sockets.  
  
The challenge encourages you to try implementing a simple front end with a button to copy the shortened url to the clipboard. Now I'd be lying if I told you I did the CSS part all by myself. I had to lean pretty heavily on ChatGPT for this one.   
  
Deploying the application turned out to be the most interesting part of the project. I wanted a solution that could support multiple future projects as web services, all hosted under the same domain. These projects could run on different tech stacks, so I needed flexibility, all while keeping costs low.  
  
I initially tried AWS Fargate, it seemed promising to host multiple projects as separate containerized services. However, its dynamic IPs meant frequent updates to my domains A records after every redeploy. I eventually switched to AWS Lightsail, which offered a simpler, more customizable solution within my budget. While alternatives like an application load balancer or an Elastic Network Interface (ENI) addressed the dynamic IP issue, their costs didnt fit my goals. Lightsail struck the right balance between affordability and customizability.  
  
So what did I learn?  
  
1. Docker multi stage builds: AWS Lightsails cheapest VPS only has 500 MB of RAM, so optimizing the Docker containers was crucial. By using multi-stage builds, I reduced the container size from 200+ MB to just 10 MB. I built the app in one stage and copied the binary into a fresh, minimal Alpine image in the final stage.  
  
2. Static linking: Multi-stage builds meant that C++ standard libraries werent available in the final container, so I had to use the -static flag to link everything statically.  
  
3. Nginx as a reverse proxy: My application listens on port 8080, with Docker forwarding traffic from port 8001 to it. To ensure users access the app via standard ports, I used Nginx to route traffic from port 80 for a specific subdomain to port 8001. This setup also allows me to utilize multiple subdomains, directing traffic to different projects, all hosted on the same IP.  
  
4. IPv6-only Lightsail Instances: I briefly explored using IPv6-only instances (cheaper for the same specs) but couldnt get them to work yet. I reverted to a dual-stack VPS.
