This week, I built my own lite version of shell.  
  
Truth be told, it turned into a far deeper rabbit hole than I expected. After two weeks of effort, it still feels like there's more left unsupported than supported, which is both humbling and inspiring at the same time.  
  
Currently supported functionalities:  
1 Shell native commands: cd, exit, history  
2 Runs binaries from /bin automatically  
3 Simple pipes (no redirections yet)  
4 History is auto-persisted in ~/.csh_history  
5 ~ is auto-expanded using $HOME  
6 Arrow keys for navigating history  
7 Handles Ctrl+C (interrupt) & Ctrl+D (EOF)  
  
Two particularly interesting functionalities:  
  
 Pipes  
Setting up pipes in C++ requires a fair bit of orchestration. You fork each sub-command into its own process, manage communication via dup2, and ensure the final output flows back to the main process. Ctrl+C should clean up all sub-processes properly.  
  
 Arrow Key Navigating history  
This required enabling "raw" mode in the terminal. Unlike std::getline, which waits for Enter, you now have to process every key stroke manually. Did you know that delete key is received in as "ESC[~" or that the arrow keys are received as "~[A", "~[B", etc? Without safety crutches from the default "cooked" mode (yep, that is what is called), handling backspace, deletes, and re-rendering efficiently turned out to be way harder than expected.  
  
Key Takeaway:  
A personal note to hold my complaints when Git Bash doesn't work as fast as I'd like it to, for it is doing way more under the hood than I gave it credit for :)
