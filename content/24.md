I built a header-only C++ client for Selenium WebDriver.  
  
I had always been curious about how Selenium actually works under the hood. Turns out, the real heavy lifting is done by the WebDriver itself, while Selenium bindings simply make API calls to interact with it. If you have a good JSON parser and an HTTP library, you're already most of the way there.  
  
Why did I build this?  
  
C++ doesnt have official Selenium bindings, so I wondered, how hard could it be to implement one? Since it's essentially just about wrapping WebDriver API calls, I decided to take on the challenge.  
  
** Key Features **  
 Header-only: Easy to integrate, minimal dependencies.  
 RAII-based WebDriver session management: No manual cleanup needed.  
 Fluent API with builder pattern: Chainable, intuitive interface.  
 Detailed error handling: Custom exceptions with informative what() messages.  
 Supports Chrome, Edge, Firefox: Any browser with a compatible WebDriver should theoretically work.  
 WebDriver must be started manually: Client doesnt handle launching the driver.  
  
** Key learnings **  
1 CMake: Incredibly powerful, but I still feel like I barely understand it.  
2 CTest: Runs multiple tests, filter them by pattern, and integrate with CMakeLists.  
3 .incl files: Some header-only libraries include .incl files at the end of their headers. Interesting, but I havent used them in this project.  
4 Custom exceptions: Overriding what() provides detailed failure info when API calls break.  
5 Typecast operator overloading: Used sparingly. Some API inputs require JSON, and by overloading operator json() in classes, I can pass these objects directly where JSON is expected.
