A while ago, [Dr. Tristan Behrens (AI Guru)](https://www.linkedin.com/in/ACoAABXa5VgB_Btgbbp82dUY7I1IKbiWIx6tEhc) posted about a book: "How to read a book". Inspired, I gave it a read and I'm glad I did! For brevity, herein I only mention insights from the level author terms as "Inspectional" reading:  
  
1. Before even beginning to read a book, have a look at it's table of contents & it's index to obtain a general sense of the book's structure. A lot of us never bother to do this.   
  
2. Simply skim the contents, look at just the chapters, pages and paragraphs that seem pivotal, never more than few pages in sequence at once.  
  
3. Set an artificial time constraint, say reading as much as possible under 30 minutes. Our main aim is to discover whether the book requires a more careful reading and the parts which do.   
  
4. Never stop to look up or ponder on things you do not understand right away. Concentrate on things that you do understand. In the end, even if we understand only 50% of a book, it is much better than getting discouraged and giving up.   
  
6. It helps to understand the whole before we dive in deep, even if we decide to read a book from start till the end.  
  
I have always found it difficult to read research papers. It's the reason I started reading this book. It's only by practice that we can hope to get better, and I have a much clearer idea how!
